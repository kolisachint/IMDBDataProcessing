Source Audit Columns -> 
	Nature of source data->
		1. Full snapshot of source data
		2. CDC data of source for certain period. (day, week etc)
		3. Complete transactions as of date
		4. Transactions for period (day, week etc)
Only required columns from below list to be included in staging table which holds raw data.Propogate only if required.
		SrcSnpshtTmstmp
		SrcExtrctFrmTmstmp
		SrcExtrctToTmstmp
		CreatedBySrc
		UpdBySrc
DW Audit Columns -> When record is created/Updated in DW. -> Should Not used by any query/ data processing
		DWCreateTmstmp
		DWUpdTmstmp
DW Temporary Table Columns ->
	DWCDCInd ->
		New Row/Record-> I in All SCD implmentations
		Update to existing record -> U [ Table may be SCD1,2,7]
					U(D+I) -> In SCD1 attribute implementations
					U(D+I) + I -> In SCD2 attribute implementations
		Deleted record at source side -> U/Ignore Processing based on approach
				Check with the business/source if soft delete approach needs to be used
				Or it should be ignored to keep record active.
DW History columns ->
	DWRowEffDte
	DWRowExpDte
	DWActvRowInd - Active/Expired <CURRENT/ACTIVE>
DW Partitions for <History Maintainance> -> 
	DWRowExpDte -> 3499-12-31 -> Indicates open records
	DWRowExpMnth -> Combine <year and month> - It should be accurate. Derived column no one should use this column.
	In Big data->
		Keep only open records for SCD implementation.
		Have view which unifies open records and historical records
		While processing implement below approach
		Open records -> Delete all data and insert all data in batch. [Use rm -skipTrash + INSERT OVERWRITE]
		Historical Records -> Insert overwrite all historical data in batch [INSERT OVERWRITE]
				Have partitions based on DWRowExpMnth.
	In Teradata->Apply the same thing as above in teradata
		   PARTITION BY (
			  CASE_N (DWRowExpDte=DATE'3499-12-31',DWRowExpDte<>DATE'3499-12-31' , NO CASE, UNKNOWN),
		>>>	  RANGE_N(DWRowExpDte    BETWEEN DATE '1900-01-01' 
                                     AND     DATE '3499-12-31' 
                                     EACH INTERVAL '3' MONTH, NO RANGE, UNKNOWN));  <<<  
									<<<< Is this really required?
									<<<< Means degrading performance just to have archiving and purging solution on table?
DW Purging and Archiving Columns -> Should Not used by any query/ data processing [Hive archive purge partitions]
	Month -> DWRowExpMnth
	Year  -> DWRowExpYear
	


	
PseudoCode
1. Create a partitioned table on history columns
2. Compare new source records with target records
3. Update (Here Purge/Insert) New and open records ( Open Records )
3. Insert old records into another partition     ( Closed Records )
4. Check for soft delete is required in case record is not present in the latest snapshot of source.


SCD problems:
1	As Is data
2	Maintain history
3	Maintain current and historical record in same row
4	Frequent update - create <min dim>
5	Access <min dim data> from dim itself. Store Current min dim record key to facilitate this
6	type 1 and typ2 in same table. Use 1,2,3 SCDs. <Current> and historical record for each type2 attr.
7	Multiple typ2 attr. Use <view> to show current data of dim. Store it in FCT as well for easy access to Current value of attribute.

7 for bigdata?

type 7 for bigdata
FCT
SCD2Key - Unique across table - Join directly [Delivers as-on reporting]
SCD1Key Durable key- Unique across open records - Join with open records of dim
NK
DIM
SCD2Key - Unique across table - Join directly
SCD1Key Durable key- Unique across open records - Join with open records of dim

<Work in progress Block Start>
Open records?

e.g. check if cutomer is residing at "XY" location, check if customer has purchased goods worth more than "15$" when he was residing at "LX" location.

Use SCD2key and SCD1key

SCD1key to check for "XY" location - Current As-On Snapshot
SCD2key to check for "LX" location, purchased goods worth more than "15$" ->PIT snapshot
